My goal for this assignment was to combine different tools that we’ve learned so far in class. My code [draws generative lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4KMORhoFMk) whose thickness, color, and the area where they are drawn are modified through the [GUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzTtd79vfQw&list=PL4neAtv21WOlqpDzGqbGM_WN2hc5ZaVv7&index=18). 

When I first saw these generative lines displayed on the screen, they reminded me of the drawings I make in my sketchbook when I’m bored. They usually portray my state of mind at that moment, so my sketchbook works as a diary as well. The concept of this assignment comes from a drawing portraying a sad moment in my life. My code here reflects my effort of erasing this bad memory.
