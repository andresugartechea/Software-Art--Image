### Assignment 2 - Motion | April 25th: _"Create an animation"_

_Century_ is an artwork made on OpenFrameworks displaying an audio visualization of “Century” by the Venezuelan artist Arca. The purpose of this piece is mainly experimental, and it seeks to amplify the experience of Arca’s song with a music visualizer.

## Shapes and colors |

The visual attractiveness of the animation can be perceived with the symmetrical shapes and repetitive patterns. The animation comes from the center of the canvas to ensure a good composition for the piece. In the same way, the color choice is captivating: the background is purely black to give the highest contrast to the drawn shapes, which are colored in red and blue to differentiate one from the other. This allows the user to see how the behavior of each animation is linked to the sound frequencies. The animation can be described as harmonic since it follows the sound spectrum of the music.

## R/evolution |

As previously mentioned, this is an experimental project which signifies that the evolution of the piece is semi-random. The animation evolves according to the audio played on the program, whose frequency values are represented graphically by a curve that is displayed 8 times with different rotations. This creates a mandala effect that is pleasing to the spectator. The piece moves with song and repeats after finishing or by clicking _SPACEBAR_. 

## Concept |

The concept of this piece is inspired by Arca’s career as a DJ. This artist has become an important symbol in contemporary Queer culture, something that is one of the subject-matters of my projects. Arca’s artistic process is to add randomness to the production of their songs to achieve unexpected results. This works as a metaphor for their mutability as a non-binary person and an expression of gender-fluidity. 
With _Century_ I try to visually mimic this method to study afterwards what I can get from this experience. After finishing this project, I realized that this process is a reflection of the subconscious. With the feedback from my friends and colleagues, I understood that my artistic expression tried to equalize the song’s mysterious tone. The blue of the first animation made me think of the sound of water droplets, and the red emerges when the sounds start turning disturbing.
My own concept with this piece is to represent the randomness of emotions in situations where there are no behavioral responses dictated by nature, such as the idea of gender constructed by society. I want to develop this concept further since I’m not sure if its accessibility from a purely visual standpoint.
