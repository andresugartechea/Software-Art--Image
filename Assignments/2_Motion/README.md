### Assignment 2 - Motion | April 25th: _"Create an animation"_

_Century_ is an artwork made on OpenFrameworks displaying an audio visualization of “Century” by the Venezuelan artist Arca. The purpose of this piece is mainly experimental, and it seeks to amplify the experience of Arca’s song with a music visualizer.

## Shapes and colors |

The visual attractiveness of the animation can be perceived with the symmetrical shapes and repetitive patterns. The animation comes from the center of the canvas to ensure a good composition for the piece. In the same way, the color choice is captivating: the background is purely black to give the highest contrast to the drawn shapes, which are colored in red and blue to differentiate one from the other. This allows the user to see how the behavior of each animation is linked to the sound frequencies. The animation can be described as harmonic since it is linked to the sound spectrum of the music.
